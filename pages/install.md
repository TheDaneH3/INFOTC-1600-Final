# How to Get Started with Git and GitHub

You might be wondering how to get started with all of this *Git* and *GitHub* business. 
It may seem as though there's a lot to it at first, but the process of getting set up is quite simple!

### First, Let's Create a GitHub Account.

1. Go to the GitHub website (where you are now, or head to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)) and click on the "Sign up" button in the top-right corner of the page.

2. Fill out the sign-up form with your name, email address, and a password, and click on the "Sign up for GitHub" button.

3. After signing up, you will be redirected to the "Choose a plan" page. Select the "Free" plan, and click on the "Finish sign up" button.

4. After signing up, you will be redirected to your GitHub dashboard. From here, you can create and manage your Git repositories and other projects.

### Let's Install Git!

It is important not to confuse Git with GitHub because they are two different things. Git is a version control system that is used for managing and tracking changes to your project files, while GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories. 

Git is a tool that you can use on your local computer to manage your project files, while GitHub is a website that provides tools for collaborating on your project with others.

1. To use Git on your computer, you will need to install the Git command-line tools. To do this, go to the Git website ([https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)) and download the latest version of the Git installer for your operating system.

2. Once the Git installer has downloaded, run it and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. There may be a lot of options during set up - simply choose the default reccomended options. This configuration will be fine in most scenarios.

After installing Git, you can use it from the command line to manage your Git repositories. 

To test that it is working, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command: `git --version`

This should print the version of Git that you have installed.

That's it! You have now installed GitHub and the Git command-line tools. You can now use these tools to create and manage Git repositories and collaborate with others on your projects.

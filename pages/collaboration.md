# Collaborating with others on GitHub

GitHub provides tools for collaborating with others on your project. Here are some of the ways you can use GitHub to collaborate with others:

- **Invite collaborators:** You can invite others to collaborate on your project by sharing a link to your repository, or by adding their GitHub username in the "Collaborators" section of the repository settings.

- **Create pull requests:** Collaborators can make changes to your project files and submit them for review using "pull requests". A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch of your repository.

- **Review and discuss pull requests:** After a collaborator creates a pull request, you can review the changes and discuss them with the collaborator. You can use the "Files changed" tab to see the changes that were made, and use the "Conversation" tab to comment on the changes and discuss them with the collaborator.

- **Merge pull requests:** If you decide to accept the changes in a pull request, you can use the "Merge pull request" button to merge the changes into the main branch of your repository. This will integrate the changes into your project and make them available to all collaborators.

By using these tools, you can collaborate with others on your project in a structured and organized way. You can review and discuss changes, and merge them into the main branch of your repository when you are ready.
